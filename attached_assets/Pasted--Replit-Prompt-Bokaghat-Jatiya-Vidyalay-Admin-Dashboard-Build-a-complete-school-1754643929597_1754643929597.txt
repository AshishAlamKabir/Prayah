### 🚀 Replit Prompt: Bokaghat Jatiya Vidyalay – Admin Dashboard

> Build a complete school management system for **Bokaghat Jatiya Vidyalay** using **Flask** in **Python**, with a role-based admin dashboard and student record management. The system must support class-wise and stream-wise student data and fee tracking with promotion/demotion functionality.

---

### 📦 Technologies to Use

* **Backend**: Python (Flask)
* **Database**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL if hosted externally)
* **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
* **Frontend**: HTML + Jinja + Bootstrap
* **Auth**: Flask-Login (for session management)
* **Excel Parsing**: pandas + openpyxl

---

### 🔐 User Roles

* **Super Admin**:

  * Access to all features and data
  * Can manage other admins
* **Role-Based Admin**:

  * Can add/view students only for assigned class/branch
  * Can update fees and student status for assigned students

---

### 📚 Student Management Features

* Add students manually or upload `.xlsx` files (e.g., `XII_arts.xlsx`, `Kuhi.xlsx`)
* Fields:

  * Name, Roll No, Class, Stream (if any), Admission Date, Status
* Track `student status`: Promoted, Demoted, Dropped Out
* Automatically extract class and stream from uploaded filenames

---

### 💰 Fee Bookkeeping

Track fees by payment mode:

* Cash
* Website
* UPI

Each fee record should include:

* Student ID
* Payment amount
* Payment mode
* Payment date
* Optional remarks

Provide summary charts or tables:

* Total collected by mode
* Dues per class or student

---

### 🔁 Status Tracker

* Update status of student to:

  * Promoted (next class)
  * Demoted
  * Dropped Out (with reason)
* Log all status changes for historical tracking

---

### 📁 Excel Upload Support

* Accept `.xlsx` files like:

  * `ankur.xlsx`, `Kuhi.xlsx`, `SOPAN.xlsx`
  * `I.xlsx`, `II.xlsx`, ..., `X.xlsx`
  * `XI_arts.xlsx`, `XI_commerce.xlsx`, `XI_science.xlsx`
  * `XII_arts.xlsx`, `XII_commerce.xlsx`, `XII_science.xlsx`

Use `pandas` to parse and load data into the student table, tagging students with the correct class/stream based on the file name.

### 📊 Class Hierarchy (Chronological Order)

Define the class progression using the following structure:

```python
CLASS_ORDER = {
    "Ankur": 1,
    "Kuhi": 2,
    "Sopan": 3,
    "I": 4,
    "II": 5,
    "III": 6,
    "IV": 7,
    "V": 8,
    "VI": 9,
    "VII": 10,
    "VIII": 11,
    "IX": 12,
    "X": 13,
    "XI Arts": 14,
    "XI Commerce": 15,
    "XI Science": 16,
    "XII Arts": 17,
    "XII Commerce": 18,
    "XII Science": 19
}
```

Use this for:

* Sorting students
* Promotion logic
* Reports by education level (Primary, Secondary, etc.)
